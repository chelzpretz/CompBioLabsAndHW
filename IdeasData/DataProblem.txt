This is a document that outlines the question and data that I am interested in solving
using compuationally.

The Problem:
Filtering data from a aggerated herbarium website to later use in niche modeling programs. 

The data:
The raw data has been downloaded from SIENet, and contains many different rows of information 
that varies from: species name, collector, location, ect. The document will include the whole 
genus, Physalis, but would want to filter one species at a time. 

The approach:
Filter by species (have at top of file so can be changed)
Filter to only have long/lat
Remove all individuals that do not have long/lat information
