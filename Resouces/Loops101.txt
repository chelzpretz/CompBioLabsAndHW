Loops, Conditions, and Inputs in R

FOR LOOPS:
There are 3 main components of a loop:
1. Counter / index variable
2. Range of value for counter
3. Action / operation

for(i in 1:10){
	Operation
}

Helpful commands:
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2) #makes list of numbers
rep()			       #Makes list of numbers
vector()			#Makes a vector (list of numbers)
matrix()			#Makes a matrix
dim()				#Gives diminations of 

Pre-allocation is better than dynmaic array sizing because it is faster.

NESTED LOOPS:
You can make loops go down a row

for(i in 1:ncol()){
	for(j in 1:ncol(){
		mymartrix[j, i] <- some operation
	}
} 

Helpful commands:
write.csv(x=myData, file="Newfile"") 	#can save data into a new file


IF .. ELSE STATEMENTS
If statements are conditional statements. If something is true then do X. 

if(condition){
	operation(s)
} else { 		#else has to be on the same line as } from for statement
	other operations
}

Helpful commands:
[[]] 	#double brackets mean the whole row
== 	#if is equal to this value
>=; <= 	#Greater/less than or equal to
>;<	#Greater/less than
&	#And
!=	#not equal to 

WHILE STATEMENTS
Can help pull out or subset data.

which(is.na(vector)) #pulls al the NA in a data set
lenght(which(is.na(vector))) #give number of NAs in data set
NAindices <- which(is.na(vector)) #assigns all NA value to a new vector
vector[NAindice] <- 0 #changes all NA to zero

which(data > 5 & data < 10) #pulls out all values from 5 to 10
